 Email Automation by Rohit Bharti.

This automation tool prompts the user to enter the complete email address along with the password(which is encrypted by
 getpass so no one will be able to access your password) and let him send emails to his targetted audience present in the
 form of list provided by the user.

The way the code is written requires Python 3.7 and requires the following imports.

Note: The user must allow the less secure apps on his/her gmail account.

Requirements:
Python 3.7
smtplib
getpass
